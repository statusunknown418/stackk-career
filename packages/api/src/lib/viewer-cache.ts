 *
 * When to call:
 * - `generations.create` with `type: "resume-creation"` → `["resume_creation_generations_per_cycle"]`
 * - `generations.create` with `type: "conversation"` → `["conversation_generations_per_cycle"]`
 * - `resumes.create` (manual; inserts a `resume-manual` generation) → `["resumes_total"]`
 * - `resumeAnalyses` insert → `["resume_analyses_per_cycle"]`
 * - `coachingSessions` insert (e.g. `captureBooking`) → `["coaching_sessions_per_cycle"]`
 *
 * Skip this for **updates that don't change row count** (e.g. renaming a resume, updating
 * `bookingStatus` on an existing coaching row). Skip it for deletes only if you're sure the row
 * was never counted in the cached window.
 *
 * Safe to call with `metrics: []` — no-ops without hitting Redis.

 * @description Call this whenever the subscription itself changes: plan upgrade/downgrade, status

 * period rollover. Because every usage counter's SQL is bounded by `currentPeriodStart` /
 * `currentPeriodEnd`, any cached count from the prior cycle becomes stale the moment those dates
 * move, so they must be wiped alongside the subscription row.
 *
 * When to call:
 * - subscription bootstrap on signup (creates the `free` row) — optional; cache is empty anyway
 * - Mercado Pago webhook: `subscription created`, `payment approved`, `payment failed`,
 *   `paused`, `canceled`, `expired`, `renewal period rollover`
 * - manual admin overrides that mutate `user_subscriptions` for a user
 * - cycle rollover cron / scheduled task
 *
 * Do **not** call this from per-action mutation routes (resume creation, generation creation,
 * etc.) — use {@link invalidateViewerUsage} with the specific metric instead, otherwise you blow
 * away the entire user's cache on every write.
